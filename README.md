## Optimizations

`DISCLAIMER: Both results were obtained in a production environment and within an incognito window. Please be aware that results may vary in a development environment or in a normal browser page due to external extensions.`

During the creation of this project, we encountered various best practices for developing React Applications.

Upon completion of our project, we assessed the performance and other factors of our application, and the results were not as impressive as we had hoped.

Certainly, we were dissatisfied with these outcomes. Therefore, we implemented the following optimizations:

- We replaced `static imports` with `dynamic imports (React.lazy)` to limit the loading of non-essential pages, layouts, components, etc. This adjustment significantly improved the loading speed of the application.

- Additionally, we utilized React's `img` tag options such as `loading="instant"` and `loading="lazy"`, enabling us to instantly load essential images and defer loading of images that are not immediately required (e.g., those outside the viewport).

- Furthermore, we enhanced accessibility by adding `aria-label` to buttons and `title` attributes to anchor tags.

- We also employed the `preconnect` option on some `link` tags, instructing the browser to establish early connections to specified URLs for an enhanced user experience.

- Lastly, we implemented a `robots.txt` file to improve SEO optimization.

After implementing these optimizations, the current performance of our application is as follows:

We are excited to see the positive impact these optimizations will have on our project's performance and user experience.
