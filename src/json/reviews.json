Out of two earbuds one has stopped working and the microphone of the other doesn‚Äôt work. The earphones automatically gets disconnected in every 5-10 minutes while using and then reconnects again which is very disturbing. I exercise in gym for 2 hrs everyday. Although this product claims to be water resistant. let me tell you by my experience. this disconnect and reconnect problem started with minimal exposure to sweat while running. So it is not gym friendly at all",
